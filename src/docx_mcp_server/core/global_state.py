"""Global state management for active file tracking.

This module provides a thread-safe global state manager that tracks the currently
active file and session. It is designed to be used in HTTP mode where concurrent
requests may access the state.

Thread Safety:
    - All property access is protected by threading.Lock
    - Use the atomic() context manager for compound operations
    - Compatible with both STDIO and HTTP transports

Example:
    >>> from docx_mcp_server.core.global_state import global_state
    >>>
    >>> # Simple access
    >>> global_state.active_file = "/path/to/doc.docx"
    >>> print(global_state.active_file)
    >>>
    >>> # Compound operation
    >>> with global_state.atomic():
    >>>     if global_state.active_session_id:
    >>>         # Close session
    >>>         global_state.active_session_id = None
